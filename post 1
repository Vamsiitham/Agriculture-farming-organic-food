<p>“<a href="https://futureoffood.org/insights/the-politics-of-knowledge-compendium/">The Politics of Knowledge</a>” is a new compendium from the Global Alliance for the Future of Food about ways funders, researchers, and policymakers can help scale agroecological practices across the globe.</p>

<p>“Companies and governments have supported [industrial agriculture] by billions of dollars of investment, which has gone into systems that lock farmers into certain types of production,” says Ronnie Brathwaite, Senior Agriculture Officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), at a recent symposium focusing on the African region.</p>

<p>Industrial agricultural systems rely heavily on inputs from a few major suppliers and often require shipping food products across the globe, Brathwaite says. And weaknesses in these systems threaten food security across Africa and the globe, as recent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have exposed.</p>

<p>Brathwaite emphasizes that systemic change is necessary for food security and food sovereignty. And it’s important for the additional benefits that communities can gain from better farming practices, such as employment opportunities, income generation, strengthened rural economies, and more.</p>

<p>“That can come from agroecology,” says Brathwaite.</p>

<p>Janet Maro, Executive Director of Sustainable Agriculture Tanzania, defines agroecology as a sustainable and holistic farming system that works with nature, reducing the use of heavy external inputs, improving and sustaining biodiversity, recycling resources, and prioritizing local supply chains—all of which contribute to climate change mitigation.</p>

<p>This is a transformative approach, Maro says: “Agroecology is the way to go if we aim to feed the growing population and ensure that we’re able to produce food in ways that are sustainable also for the future generations.”</p>
